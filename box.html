In November 2014, Box acquired two-man medical-imaging software startup MedXT for $3.84 million.[11]

On January 23, 2015 Box held its initial public offering on the NYSE. The IPO price was $14.00. It opened at $20.20 and closed at $23.23. The IPO raised $175 million and established a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion.[12]
